## ðŸŽ“ How to Use This DoD

### For Solo Developer:

1. **Before starting a task:**
   - Read relevant DoD section
   - Understand what "done" means
   - Estimate based on DoD requirements

2. **During development:**
   - Keep DoD checklist visible
   - Check off items as you go
   - Don't skip items to "save time"

3. **Before committing:**
   - Go through entire checklist
   - Ensure all items checked
   - Fix any missing items

4. **Before PR/merge:**
   - Final DoD review
   - Self-review with fresh eyes
   - Merge only when 100% done

### Why DoD Matters:

âœ… **Prevents technical debt** - No "I'll fix it later" mindset  
âœ… **Maintains quality** - Consistent standards across codebase  
âœ… **Reduces bugs** - Caught early through checklist  
âœ… **Professional habit** - Industry best practice  
âœ… **Portfolio value** - Shows discipline & quality focus

## ðŸ“Š DoD Compliance Tracking

Track your DoD compliance per sprint:

| Sprint | Tasks | DoD Met | % | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|---|-------|
| 1      | 7     | TBD     | TBD | |
| 2      | TBD   | TBD     | TBD | |
| 3      | TBD   | TBD     | TBD | |
| 4      | TBD   | TBD     | TBD | |

**Goal:** 100% DoD compliance for all tasks!

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

### Start Small:
- Sprint 1: Focus on Code Quality & Git sections
- Sprint 2: Add Testing requirements
- Sprint 3: Add all sections
- Sprint 4: Perfect compliance

### Be Honest:
- Don't skip items "because it's solo project"
- This is LEARNING opportunity
- Build professional habits now

### Adjust if Needed:
- Some items might not apply to all tasks
- Use common sense
- But don't skip just because "lazy"

### Learn from Failures:
- If bug found after "done" = DoD item missing
- Update DoD with new item
- Prevent same mistake next time

## ðŸŽ¯ Remember

> **"Done" means DONE. Not "mostly done" or "done except for tests".**

Quality is not negotiable. DoD ensures every piece of work meets professional standards.

**Your future self (and future employers) will thank you!** ðŸš€
